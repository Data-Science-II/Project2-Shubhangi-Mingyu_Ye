Report done for the work done

Configuration to Setup: 
Install Python Version 3.7 
Libraries included and needed to be installed in Python 
1. Scikit learn 
2. Pandas 
3. NumPy  
4. Tensorflow. 
5. Keras

How to run?

1. Open terminal Run jupyter notebook Open “.ipynb” file from jupyter notebook
2. Download each dataset and run separately by providing path for each dataset in the code

Data Sets used- Downloaded data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository

Mingyu Sun- Forward, Backward, Stepwise Regression for TranRegression, Perceptron Model, 3 Layers Neural Network and XL-Neural Network models with scalation.
Download project2.scala, PredictorMat.scala, PredictorMat2.scala, NeuralNet_XL.scala replace the PredictorMat.scala, PredictorMat2.scala, NeuralNet_XL.scala and add project2.scala under scalation_1.6/scalation_modeling/src/main/scala/scalation/analytics. The whole project2 should be run inside scalation_1.6, with the following code

cd scalation_1.6 $ ./build_all.sh cd scalation_modeling sbt runMain scalation.analytics.the_object

TranRegressionsel includes Forward, Backward, Stepwise Regression, similar for Perceptronsel, NeuralNet_3Lsel, NeuralNet_XLsel
